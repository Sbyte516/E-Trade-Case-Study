## Historic Overview
### E-Trade
E*TRADE Financial Corporation is an American financial services company that offers an electronic trading platform to trade financial assets including common stocks, preferred stocks, futures contracts, exchange-traded funds, options, mutual funds, and fixed income investments. It also provides services for employee 
stock ownership plans, student loan benefit administration, advisor services, margin lending, online banking, and cash management services. Established by founders William A. Porter & Bernard A. Newcomb, in San Francisco in 1991, E-trade become the fastest-growing private company in the United States.

The idea of E-trade came to fruition by way of William Porter and Bernard Newcomb's innovative desire for deep-discount brokerage services. Instead of the monthly fees charged by TradePlus, E-Trade the subsidiary would offer flat-rate trading and free information services via the online services, including America Online and CompuServe. In 1991 William Porter and Bernard Newcomb founders of TradePlus decide to establish a new brokerage company, E-Trade Securities Inc.

E-Trade became a public company in 1996 via an initial public offering, where they received their funding through an IPO, which at the time the company had received an estimated 46.4 million for money raised at IPO. 

## Business Activities
Access to online investment was just bergeoning, there were few companies in the beginning that provided investment services through an online median 
and offered trading for day to day up to the minute transactions for a plethora of investment opportunities. E-trade aimed to close the gap in this department, 
the company took it upon themselves to allow access to online investing and trading to its customers and a host of other financial services related to wealth 
management and banking, availability of investment information, accessible by the online services' customers 24 hours per day, to cut the cost of trading, while 
automating transactions between customer and host.

This opened up a whole new relm of possiblilities.
