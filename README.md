## Historic Overview
### E-Trade
E*TRADE Financial Corporation is an American financial services company that offers an electronic trading platform to trade financial assets including common stocks, preferred stocks, futures contracts, exchange-traded funds, options, mutual funds, and fixed income investments. It also provides services for employee 
stock ownership plans, student loan benefit administration, advisor services, margin lending, online banking, and cash management services. Established by founders William A. Porter & Bernard A. Newcomb, in San Francisco in 1991, E-trade become the fastest-growing private company in the United States.

The idea of E-trade came to fruition by way of William Porter and Bernard Newcomb's innovative desire for deep-discount brokerage services. Instead of the monthly fees charged by TradePlus, E-Trade the subsidiary would offer flat-rate trading and free information services via the online services, including America Online and CompuServe. In 1991 William Porter and Bernard Newcomb founders of TradePlus decide to establish a new brokerage company, E-Trade Securities Inc.

E-Trade became a public company in 1996 via an initial public offering, where they received their funding through an IPO, which at the time the company had received an estimated 46.4 million for money raised at IPO. 

## Business Activities
Access to online investment was just bergeoning, there were few companies in the beginning that provided investment services through an online median 
and offered trading for day to day up to the minute transactions for a plethora of investment opportunities. E-trade aimed to close the gap in this department, 
the company took it upon themselves to allow access to online investing and trading to its customers and a host of other financial services related to wealth 
management and banking, availability of investment information, accessible by the online services' customers 24 hours per day, to cut the cost of trading, while 
automating transactions between customer and host.

Technologies implemeted by E-trade include the following:

J-Query 
Is a lightweight, “write less, do more”, JavaScript Library. The purpose of J-Query is to make it much easier to use Java on your website.  J-Query takes a lot of common tasks that may require many lines of JavaScript, and wraps into single line of code.  This program also simplifies complicated things from JavaScript, like Ajax calls and DOM manipulation. J-Query also contains plugins for most tasks. JQ-is essentially a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML
The JQ library contains: (HTIML/DOM manipulation, CSS manipulation, HTML event methods, Effects and animations, AJAX, Utilities).  Concluding J-Query is simply a library, which is just a collection of tools that allows us to implement functionalities of effects without the need to write all the code that is really needed to do it.  
E-Trade like most web-based apps would more be likely to use this for cross-platform functionality, across all web based-severs, to have an integrated user-friendly interface for better access to information while promoting and facilitating client /consumer transactions between the client and host.

Apache HTTP Server

Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content. 

E-Trade may use this function Apache HTTP Server to streamline communication across a larger world-wide network, to improve connectivity and service, allowing the severe software to be implemented on multiple computing platforms. 

Animate.css - Is a proposed module for Cascading Style Sheets that allows the animation of HTML document elements using CSS. This may be used in order to render images on a website for marketing or advertising purposes, and or create a personalized experience for the end user.

## Landsacpe
E-trade occupies the domain of Financial Service Investment

Marjor innovations and trends of E-trade for the last 10-5 years has been as follows:

Banking Firms such as Morgan Stanley and Charles Schwab are moving towards acquiring financial service investment companies like E-trade & TD Ameritrade, targeting smaller everyday investors of more moderate wealth, on larger scale, a rush for more mom and pop investors. A positive trend for consumers, putting financial advice at the finger-tips of a population that hadn't previously had access.

Morgan Stanley announced in February of 2020 that it is buying E-Trade, an online brokerage and digital bank, for$13 billion. Which will then incorporate its full-service, financial-advisor-driven business model with E-Trade’s digital brokerage and banking business, to manage money for investors more cheaply. with the aim of keeping younger customers long-term as they grow wealth and turn to the firm for more help, and to sell a broader array of services to current customers.

## Recommendations
An area where E-Trade falls short, that company could make adjustments and improvements to me would be its ability to directly access international markets or to trade foreign currencies. By doing so E-Trade could open up a portal to new investment and money making opportunities that would offset the cost of competing with companies within the same space, among other advantages that internation trade has to offer, that we will be metioned here. 

Top advantages of international trade is you may be able to increase your number of potential clients. Each country you add to your list can open up a new pathway to business growth and increased revenues.
national survey of 1,004 small business leaders conducted, shows that business leaders engaged in global trade say they're growing faster and hiring more employees than small businesses who stay stateside.

Decreased competition is also a good reason to adopt this strategy, your product and services may have to compete in a crowded market in the U.S, but you may find that you have less competition in other countries.

Longer product lifespan sales can dip for certain products domestically as Americans stop buying them or move to upgraded versions over time. Selling a product to an overseas market can extend the life of an existing product as emerging markets seek to buy American products.

Easier cash-flow management, getting paid upfront may be one of the hidden advantages of international trade. When trading internationally, it may be a general practice to ask for payment upfront, whereas at home you may have to be more creative in managing cash flow while waiting to be paid. Expanding your business overseas could help you manage cash flow better.

Better risk management One of the significant advantages of international trade is market diversification. Focusing only on the domestic market may expose you to increased risk from downturns in the economy, political factors, environmental events and other risk factors. Becoming less dependent on a single market may help you mitigate potential risks in your core market.

Benefiting from currency exchange Those who add international trade to their portfolio may also benefit from currency fluctuations. For example, when the U.S. dollar is down, you may be able to export more as foreign customers benefit from the favorable currency exchange rate.

Disposal of surplus goods One of the advantages of international trade is that you may have an outlet to dispose of surplus goods that you're unable to sell in your home market.

Enhanced reputation Doing business in other countries can boost your company's reputation. Successes in one country can influence success in other adjacent countries, which can raise your company's profile in your market niche. It can also help increase your company's credibility, both abroad 
and at home. This is one of the advantages of international trade that may be difficult to quantify and, therefore, easy to ignore.

Opportunity to specialize International markets can open up avenues for a new line of service or products. It can also give you an opportunity to specialize in a different area to serve that market.

Technologies that would provide solutions for this challange would be to implemente Blockchain Technologies, as well as the use of Atrificial Intelligence and Macine learning Algorithims.

By implementing Blockchain Technologies companies are able to by-pass the Line Of Credit (LoC) altogether by providing real-time tracking of goods and inventory financing that de-risks transactions, and allows financiers to provide working capital relief to all supply chain partners at the lowest cost of capital in that chain.

More than efficiencies gain and better consumer services, AI is being used to make global trade sustainableusing real-time machine learning tools, allowing governments and other organizations are able to identify suspicious behaviors and develop sustainable policies. This not only good or the investor, it also provides a way of keeping up with changes on the international trade circuit.
